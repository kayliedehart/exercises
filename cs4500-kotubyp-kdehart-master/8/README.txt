PURPOSE:

Create an implementation of the Dealer in a game of Evolution that can execute the feeding procedure,
and test for correctness of implementation. Determine requirements for the Player to implement to 
interface with the Dealer. 

FILES:

8/dealer/dealer.py is the dealer of the Evolution game

8/dealer/testDealer.py is the unit tests for the dealer class

8/dealer/feeding/ contains all the necessary game components from previous projects

8/xstep.py is the test harness for the dealer's feed1 method

8/testXstep.py is the unit tests for the test harness xstep

8/xstep is the executable for xstep.py

8/compile is an executable that does compiling for the python files in project 8

8/rest.txt is a wishlist of methods for the player class in the Evolution game

8/json-tests contains unit test cases for the xstep test harness; input is named xstep-[n]-in.json,
	and the corresponding output is named xstep-[n]-out.json


RUNNING THE CODE:

To run the test harness, run ./compile and then run ./xstep <json-input>

To run the unit tests, run python test[Filename].py 


READING THE CODE:

Start reading the code in dealer.py, and read into subsequent files as needed.
