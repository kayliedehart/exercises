Assignment 7 - README

plain-bools*.json - types two plain booleans into xstream
reg-json*.json - a single-line simple json case
split*.json - a single json case split across two lines
two-split*.json - two json cases split across several lines

To use these test cases, pipe them into xstream as you would with xfeed. 

To understand these, read the -in and -out files together to piece together
expected behavior for xstream.
