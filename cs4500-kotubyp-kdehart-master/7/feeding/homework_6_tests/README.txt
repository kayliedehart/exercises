Assignment 7 - README

*-in.json - input file to test feed()
*-out.json - expected output for the matching infile

To run these, either run our unit tests in ../tests.py or use xfeed.

These are the tests from hw6 TestFest with the expected output modified
to use indices instead of Species, OptSpecies, Players, etc.
