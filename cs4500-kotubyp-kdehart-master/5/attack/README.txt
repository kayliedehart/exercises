README - Assignment 5

__init__.py - makes this folder into a Python package
species.py - Holds data structures + functions for task 1
tests.py - Internal unit tests for species

To use species.py, you'll want to use xattack in the containing folder. 
See that README for how to run it.

To understand species.py, first read through the species data structure, then
isAttackable() (the main function). convertSpecies() simply converts a json 
array into an internal Species object and is not particularly important.
