README 

Implement the player interface functionality given specifications from another team.

player.py - Contains requested functionality for a 6 Nimmt player
take5 - A directory containing task 2 and its README

To launch this code, plug it into existing back end which contains all other components of a 6 Nimmt game.

The original specifications for the player interface were left at the top of the file. We implemented the desired functions towards the bottom of the file. For more information on the take5 directory, see take5/README.txt.
