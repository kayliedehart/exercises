The purpose of this project is to outline the player interface
and structure for the German game, 6 Nimmt.

player-interface.txt - outlines the player interface. 
our-teenage-heartbreak-language.pdf - a memo to a theoretical
                                      boss justifying our language choice

In order to understand this program skeleton, a combination of 
comments and code fragments detail to a user what they can expect
within each class of the 6 Nimmt game. The MainProgram class is 
where the game will first be initialized. The Dealer class will 
contain most of the information on how the game is organized and
run. Finally, the Player class will define a single player of 
the 6 Nimmt game.
