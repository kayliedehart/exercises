Methods changed:
-- discard: stacks is no longer an argument to the method. The method
updates the player's "selected" field

-- choose-stack : stacks is no longer an argument and method returns the index
of the chosen stack rather than returning the chosen stack

-- update_bull_points: removed, no longer needed
-- Dealer no longer requires a deck argument
-- Added create_deck method to create an initial deck of cards
-- changed add_cards to create_stacks because we create 4 new stacks, each
having 1 card  and updated purpose statement
-- generate_deck in main no longer needed
