We found many ambiguities in the specifications: 


1) in the player class:

	self.selected : it is not clear what they are referring to,
	so we assume it refers to the index of the card that will be
	 discarded from the player's hand

	card_position: is it the discarded card? 

	what does  # for now, "players" is an integer means --> number of players? 


2) the way of passing arguments is different as shown below.
	We are resolving it by using the __init__ function
	to pass arguments to the fields of the class

  a) no arguments are passed in: 
  	 e.g: 
		in the card class : 
 		 class Card:
			self.number =  # integer in range [1,104]. UNIQUE.
			self.bull =  # integer in range [2,7]

   b) the values for fields are not passed in correctly: 
      e.g: 
     	class Stack(cards=None):

We also encountered under specification in the player class: 
  1) They do not have name as a field in the player class,
  to resolve this we add name as a field in the player class
  2) they do not have bull_points accumulated in the player class,
   to resolve this we add bull_points as a field in the player class
