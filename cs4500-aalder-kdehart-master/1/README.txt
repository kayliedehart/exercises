A proposed interface between the player and game components for the game 6 Nimmt! 

player-interface.txt is the skeleton of the Player, Dealer, Card, and Stack Components,
including associated fields but without internal implementation details. (Please note:
components will likely be broken into separate files upon implementating.) It also
contains the protocol for knowledge exchange between components at a high level that will
be executed by the main function.
