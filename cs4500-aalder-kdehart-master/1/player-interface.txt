# Interface for Player component interacting with the main 6 Nimmt! game components

"""
From a high level, there are three components: the Player, the Dealer, and the 
main program, which executes the game protocol. Cards and Stacks are subcomponents 
that are used by the Player and the Dealer; Cards are used and exchanged between the 
Player and Dealer as defined by the main program, and are also a subcomponent of Stacks.

	Protocol: 
	1. Create a Dealer, pass in a list of newly generated Players (quantity specified in command line).
	2. Dealer passes 10 cards from Dealer.deck to each Player.
	3. Dealer generates 4 1-Card Stacks (taken from Dealer.deck) and passes a list of those 4 Cards to each Player
	4. Each Player passes 1 card to the Dealer
	5.1. Dealer gives Player with smallest Card.number the updated Stacks according to the Player's Card;
		-If the Player's Card can be placed without penalty, return an empty list
		-If the Player's Card results in an overflow (more than 5 cards in a Stack), pass that Stack to Player and update Stack with Player's Card
		-If the Player's Card is smaller than all top Cards, return a list of all Stacks to the Player
			5.2. Player indicates to Dealer which Stack they're keeping
		Dealer moves on and repeats step 5.1 with Player with next smallest Card.number until all Cards have been placed
	6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until Players are out of Cards
	7. Players pass their self.bull to main
	8. main announces winner of game or creates new Dealer with current list of Players and repeats steps 2-7.
